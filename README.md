# Lede-Project1-Birdwatching
Analyzing the stats for bird sighting submission 

### eBird.org, run by Cornell Ornitology, collects data from birders from around the world

I wanted to see if bird watching is affected by bad weather, and in particular by recent air quality problems caused by Canadian wildfires. 

I also looked at a few other patterns in bird watching.
